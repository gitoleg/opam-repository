synopsis: "BAP Rule Engine Library"
description: """
BARE is a library that provides non-linear pattern matching on streams
of facts that are represented as s-expressions. We use BARE, in particular,
to process Primus observations. Since Primus components use observations to
convey their knowledge downstream it is very convenient to be able to query
and join observations through the stream. In a sense, BARE could be seen as
SQL select/join for streams."""
